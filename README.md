#### 🔭 I’m currently working on:
I'm actually employee as Frontend Developer on Streamloots, but on my spare time I am working on:
  - A small productivity webapp that focus less in gamification and more in introspection.
#### 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- <a href="https://remix.run/">Remix</a>.
- Improving my typescript with <a href="https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges">type challenges</a> and articles related to TS type system. Waiting the <a href="https://www.mattpocock.com/">Advanced Typescript course from Matt Pocock</a>.
- Re doing <a href="https://css-for-js.dev/">CSS for JS</a> course.
- In my spare time, trying to learn Blender.
